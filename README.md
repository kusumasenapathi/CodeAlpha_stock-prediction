This project aims to predict stock prices using various machine learning algorithms. The model leverages historical stock data and other financial indicators to forecast future prices, helping investors make informed decisions.

Features
Historical data collection and preprocessing
Multiple prediction algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM, ARIMA)
Data visualization for better understanding of trends and predictions
Easy-to-use interface for running predictions and visualizing results

Data Collection
Download historical stock data from your preferred source (e.g., Yahoo Finance) and save it in the data directory.
